# Logistic Regression on Cancer Data

This project implements a simple **Logistic Regression** model to classify cancer data using Python and Scikit-learn.

## Project Structure

- `logistic_reg_notebook.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing the full implementation, visualization, and evaluation of the logistic regression model on the dataset.

## Dataset

The project uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic** dataset, which is included in Scikit-learn.

- Features include measurements like radius, texture, perimeter, area, etc.
- The target is binary: **Malignant (0)** or **Benign (1)**.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Open `logistic_reg_notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all the cells to train and evaluate the model.

## Output

- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report
- ROC Curve
